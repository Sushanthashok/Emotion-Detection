# 😄 Emotion Detection App

A **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts human emotions from facial images using a pre-trained **FER2013 deep learning model**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **FER2013 dataset** to classify facial expressions into one of seven emotions:

> Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral

The app automatically detects faces in an uploaded image (using **MTCNN** or OpenCV) and displays the detected emotion with confidence scores.
